        <h2><a name="id0"></a>Overview</h2> 
        <p>DevOps is a methodology in the software development and IT industry. Used as a set of practices and tools, DevOps integrates and automates the work of software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) as a means for improving and shortening the systems development life cycle. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="external">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps</a> </p> 
        <h2><a name="id1"></a>CI/CD</h2> 
        <p>CI/CD - Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery</p> Continuous delivery (CD) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time and, following a pipeline through a "production-like environment", without doing so manually. It aims at building, testing, and releasing software with greater speed and frequency. The approach helps reduce the cost, time,[citation needed] and risk of delivering changes by allowing for more incremental updates to applications in production. A straightforward and repeatable deployment process is important for continuous delivery. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="external">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery</a> 
        <br /> 
        <br /> In software engineering, continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. Nowadays it is typically implemented in such a way that it triggers an automated build with testing. Grady Booch first proposed the term CI in his 1991 method,although he did not advocate integrating several times a day. Extreme programming (XP) adopted the concept of CI and did advocate integrating more than once per day â€“ perhaps as many as tens of times per day. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="external">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration</a>
