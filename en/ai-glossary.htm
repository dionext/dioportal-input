<h1>AI. Glossary </h1>
<p><strong>Artificial intelligence&nbsp;(AI)</strong>, in its broadest sense, 
is&nbsp;intelligence&nbsp;exhibited by&nbsp;machines, particularly&nbsp;computer systems. It is 
a&nbsp;field of research&nbsp;in&nbsp;computer science&nbsp;that develops and studies methods 
and&nbsp;software&nbsp;that enable machines to&nbsp;perceive their environment&nbsp;and 
use&nbsp;learning&nbsp;and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of 
achieving defined goals.&nbsp;Such machines may be called AIs. </p>
<p><strong>Generative pre-trained transformers&nbsp;(GPT)</strong> are a type 
of&nbsp;large language model&nbsp;(LLM) and a prominent framework for&nbsp;generative 
artificial intelligence.&nbsp;They are&nbsp;artificial neural networks&nbsp;that are used 
in&nbsp;natural language processing&nbsp;tasks.&nbsp;GPTs are based on 
the&nbsp;transformer&nbsp;architecture, pre-trained on large&nbsp;data sets&nbsp;of unlabelled text, 
and able to generate novel human-like content.&nbsp;As of 2023, most LLMs have these 
characteristics&nbsp;and are sometimes referred to broadly as GPTs.</p>
<p><strong>Generative AI (GenAI)</strong> is currently a hot topic in the tech 
world. It’s a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new 
content, such as text, images, or music. One popular type of GenAI component is 
the Large Language Model (LLM), which can generate human-like text based on a 
prompt.</p>
<p><strong>Artificial general intelligence (AGI)</strong> is a type of 
artificial intelligence (AI) that matches or surpasses human cognitive 
capabilities across a wide range of cognitive tasks. This contrasts with narrow 
AI, which is limited to specific tasks. Artificial superintelligence (ASI), on 
the other hand, refers to AGI that greatly exceeds human cognitive capabilities. 
AGI is considered one of the definitions of strong AI.

<p><strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong> is a technique that 
enhances the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models by grounding them 
in external knowledge sources. While most GenAI applications and related content 
are centered around Python and its ecosystem, what if you want to write a GenAI 
application in Java?</p>
<p><strong>Low-rank adaptation (LoRA)</strong> is a technique for quickly 
adapting machine learning models to new contexts. LoRA helps make huge and 
complicated machine learning models much more suited for specific uses. It works 
by adding lightweight pieces to the original model, as opposed to changing the 
entire model. LoRA helps developers quickly expand the use cases for the machine 
learning models they build.

OpenAI model requests are priced based on the number of tokens used: that is, 
the “cost” of calling the API depends on the length of both the input and output 
text.</span></span></span></p>

<strong>“vibe coding”</strong> represents a shift where anyone can build 
software by describing what they want in plain English to AI tools.&nbsp;

<strong>Model Context Protocol </strong>The Model Context Protocol is an open 
standard that enables developers to build secure, two-way connections between 
their data sources and AI-powered tools. The architecture is straightforward: 
developers can either expose their data through MCP servers or build AI 
applications (MCP clients) that connect to these servers.
